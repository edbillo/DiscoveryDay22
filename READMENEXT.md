# Let's Go

Navigate to the online Python code editor at the following url:

See if you can figure out how to run the code and understand what it does. Once you get yours working, 
help your friends :-)

```python
def sum(a, b):
    return (a + b)

a = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))
b = int(input('Enter 2nd number: '))

print(f'Sum of {a} and {b} is {sum(a, b)}')
```
