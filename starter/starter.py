# PROGRAMMING PROJECT #1

# 1. Change the function name from sum to add.

# 2. In the function now , use a new variable to store the sum, and return this new variable.

# 3. Just before the print statement, use a variable to store the result of calling the add
#    function. Now, change the print statement to output the sum using the new variable.
